                    After finishing school I decided to work full-time and took on a part time web authoring course,
                    where I was first introduced to code (HTML/CSS) and took great pleasure in completing it. I soon
                    decided to get into college and persue a computer science degree.

                <p>
                    In my spare time I enjoy a variety of things such as reading, gym and music- I play the violin and have
                    completed 6 profesional abrsm grades (years) however I paused it to complete my degree (Quite the regret)
                    I also am bit of an artist in the  free time I have on the side.
