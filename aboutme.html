            <div class="content" >
                <p>Hi There! Im Inez, a Second year Computer Science student with a passion for programming, web developement and digital art (ranging from editing photos to logo design).
                        
                </p>
                <p>Two years ago I completed a beginner friendly web-Authoring course (while working full time) And this sparked my 
                    journey into web developement. Since then, ive honed my programming skills in Python, Java, HTML/CSS and I'm currently
                    expanding my expertise with SQL. Beyong code, art has always been significant in my life. From traditional drwing and painting
                    to recently embracing digital mediums, I aim to blend creativity with technology in my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With three years experience in the hospitality industry, from waitressing to bartendering, Ive learned the value of discipline,
                    teamwork, and handling diverse people and challenges. Now im excited to focus on the tec world and explore the oportunities
                    in freelance web developement and comissioned artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If youâ€™re looking for someone with ambition, creativity, and a hands-on approach to solving problems, you're in the right place. 
                    Explore my work, and feel free to reach out for collaborations, freelance projects, commissioned art or just even a friendly chat.
                </p>
